Firebase Crashlytics and Google Analytics For Firebase may also employ tracking technologies on our application. These 3rd-party services are **strictly used for improving user experience and website uptime**. YAPP does **not run ads or sell user information** .

We have implemented reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process, in compliance with Firebase/Google Cloud's security guidlines, recommendations, and best practices. We also utilize tools like GitHub code scanning and security policy, to minimize threats against known CVEs and exploits. However, **no electronic transmission or online information storage** can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that your information will be 100% safe.

Do Not Track Policy
-------------------

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, that practice will be included in a revised version of this privacy notice.
